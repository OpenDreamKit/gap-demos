    "# The number of numerical semigroups with given genus\n",

    "A *numerical semigroup* is a submonoid of the set of nonnegative integers with respect to addition, with the special property that only finitely many positive integers do not belong to the semigroup. These integers not in the numerical semigroup are called *gaps*, and their cardinality, the *genus* of the numerical semigroup.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of numerical semigroups with a given genus seems to grow as the genus grows. It was [conjectured](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00233-007-9014-8) (and later [solved](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00233-012-9456-5)) that this sequence grows as the Fibonacci series.\n",

[FranyMonoids](https://http://gap-packages.github.io/FrancyMonoids) takes profit of them both. In order to use it in GAP we load it with `LoadPackage`.\n",

    "Even though it has been shown that the number of numerical semigroups with given genus grows like the Fibonacci sequence, we still do not know if there are more numerical semigroups with genus $g+1$ than numerical semigroups with genus $g$. This is true asymptotically, and for genus less than 71.\n",

    "## The tree of numerical semigroups\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given numerical semigroup $S$, if $n$ is such that it cannot be written as a sum of two nonzero elements of $S$, then $S\\setminus\\{n\\}$ is a numerical semigroup with genus the genus of $S$ plus one. The elemens $n$ with this condition are known as *atoms*, *irreducibles* or *minimal generators* of $S$, and it is easy to show that there are finitely many of them. Also if $S$ is a numerical semigroup and $F$ is the largest integer not in $S$ (known as the *Frobenius number* of $S$), then $S\\cup\\{F\\}$ is again a numerical semigroup with genus equal to the genus of $S$ minus one. One can easily see that we can arrange the set of all numerical semigroup with genus up to $g$ in a tree rooted in $\\mathbb{N}$ and where each level $i$ contains all numerical semigroups with genus $i$. In order to construct the next level one removes minimal generators greater than the Frobenius number (in this way we do not get repetitions). The way this tree is constructed gives different algorithms to compute all numerical semigroups with a given genus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us have a look at the tree of numerical semigroups with genus up to 6. We start with $\\mathbb{N}$, whose unique minimal generator is $1$ and Frobenius number -1. After removing it, we obtain $\\{0,2,3,\\to\\}$ with minimal generators $2$ and $3$, and Frobenius number 1. Then we can remover either $2$ or $3$, and keep repeating this process until we reach genus $6$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Francy gives the possibility of drawing [d3js](https://d3js.org) [interactive trees](http://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/8375092). Methods to construct trees and draw them using GAP are provided in francy."
